### What is GitHub Copilot?

Basically it is a code assistant that uses Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. Trained in billions of lines of public code, such as GPT-3

GitHub Copilot will autocomplete the repetitive code producing code recommendations that are the most probable according to the context, let's see an example 🧑‍💻

hahaha ok, that is very simple, lets try something with more logic, like a typical interview problem for see if the Copilot can resolve it and get a job into google or facebook.

Well, the implementation is not the most optimal -> O (n), but it managed to solve the problem in seconds, can you? XD

conclusion? well, it can be said that github copilot is an excellent tool to streamline repetitive work, generating "common" code, such as importing libraries, generating plots, functions that may take some time, and recommendations based on the context, Those features are what I have used and it is surely the tip of the iceberg, what other features have you managed to use from this excellent tool?
